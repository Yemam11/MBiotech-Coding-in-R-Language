#Hangman

#PLAN
#1. Prepare a dictionary of words to choose from and save it in a txt file (one column) 
#and save it in the project directory
#2. Read the word list from your program.
#3. Choose a random element from the list.
#Hint: You may want to check sample() and sample.int() functions (or other methods).
#Create a nice opening prompt to the game 
#4. Inform the user on the length of the secret word. Hint: You may test nchar()
#5. Inform the user about the number of wrong guesses/tries allowed. 
#Decide on the rule here and implement it.
#while loop (condition - when wrong guesses < max wrong guess then continue with loop) 
#break end it when wrong guesses = max wrong guess = game over
#6. Ask for user input. The user is expected to enter one character only.
#### may or may not need repeat loop - should be okay with just while loop ####
#repeat loop - prompt for user inputs
#7. Check System for one character 
#within the repeat loop
  #check if the character is a letter
  #make sure that both lower and upper case letters are acceptable and treated as equivalent
#SIDE NOTE - create a vector to keep track of correctly guessed letters
#8. Check to see if the user input is in the secret word. (correct)
  #If yes, notify user and ask for next letter or guess the whole word
      #Always notify the user about the correct letters/wrong letters, remaining tries.
      #Provide the user with a visual clue of how they are progressing - update _ _ _ _ with 
      #correct guessed letters 
      #repeat
  #If not, notify user.
      #If user has not exhausted the available tries repeat.
      #Always notify the user about the correct letters/wrong letters, remaining tries.
      #Provide the user with a visual clue of how they are progressing - update _ _ _ _ with 
      #correct guessed letters 
      #OR
      #If tries are exhausted, notify user that theyâ€™ve lost. Reveal secret and exit.

##DISPLAY a hangman like game, have the _ _ _ _ spaces for each letter, have a wrong guesses
#section - MAKE IT FUN! 

#make sure you put your hangman.txt file in your working directory, replace it with your wd
setwd("/Users/viantran/Downloads/MBiotech/MBiotech-Coding-in-R-Language")

#clear environment
rm(list=ls())

#PREP WORK BEFORE THE HANGMAN FUNCTION
#load in and read the list of words from "hangman.txt", it will present it as a 
#character vector
word_list <- readLines("hangman.txt", warn = FALSE)

#pick a random word from the list
#the sample() function will pick one word from the list
secret_word <- sample(word_list, 1)
#provides the length/number of characters of the secret word
secret_word_length <- nchar(secret_word)

#number of wrong guesses allowed - head, body, 2 arms, 2 legs 
max_wrong_guesses <- 6

#wrong guesses tracker, currently set to 0 (helps us keep track of the number of wrong guesses)
wrong_guesses <- 0 

#wrong guesses letter tracker, currently empty (helps us keep track of the letters already 
#guessed)
wrong_guesses_list <- c()

#correctly guessed letter tracker 
guessed_word <- rep("_", secret_word_length)

#Introductions to the game, character length of word, and rules 
cat("Welcome to the game of hangman! Let's \"hang\" and play a quick game! \n
Your secret word has been chosen and the length of the secret word is", 
    secret_word_length, "characters long. \nYou're allowed up to", 
    max_wrong_guesses, 
    "wrong guesses in this game.\nYou can enter one letter or if you think you know the word, you can enter the full word. \n
Good luck! We will be watching.")
